 To use ONLY the following minimum necessary permissions and none of the extras supported by Expo in a default managed app, set \`permissions\` to \`[]\`. The minimum necessary permissions do not require a Privacy Policy when uploading to Google Play Store and are:
• receive data from Internet
• view network connections
• full network access
• change your audio settings
• prevent device from sleeping

 To use ALL permissions supported by Expo by default, do not specify the \`permissions\` key.

  To use the minimum necessary permissions ALONG with certain additional permissions, specify those extras in \`permissions\`, e.g.

 \`[ \\"CAMERA\\", \\"ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\\" ]\`.

  You can specify the following permissions depending on what you need:

- \`ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION\`
- \`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\`
- \`ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION\`
- \`CAMERA\`
- \`RECORD_AUDIO\`
